        Welcome to <em>Book of the Month</em>! 
        This website located at www.bookofthemonth.com (the "Site") is owned and operated by Bookspan, LLC. 
        This Site and any purchases made through this Site are governed by the Membership Terms described below, 
        as well as the <Link className="link" to="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</Link> and <Link className="link" to="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link> (collectively, "Terms"). You must be at least 18 years old to 
        purchase products from this Site or use the <em>Book of the Month</em> services. By using this Site, purchasing items through 
        this Site, and/or enrolling as a member of <em>Book of the Month</em>, you are agreeing to these Terms 
        (including automatic renewal of your membership), so please review this entire page carefully.
      </p>

      <h6>MEMBERSHIP PLAN OPTIONS</h6>
      <p>
        <em>Book of the Month</em> offers four membership plan options: 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month. 
        The cost of the 1-month plan is $16.99 per month, the 3-month plan is $44.97 ($14.99 per month), 
        and the 12-month plan is $143.88 ($11.99 per month). The 6-month plan may only be purchased as a gift membership.  
        Based on the membership plan you select, the applicable membership plan fee will be charged to your credit/debit card at 
        the time of enrollment or renewal.  From time to time, we make various offers available that provide 
        prospective new members with an opportunity to try <em>Book of the Month</em> at a reduced rate for an initial period.  
        All membership plans other than gift plans automatically renew unless you notify us before your membership period expires 
        that you wish to cancel by using the <Link className="link" to="/contact-us">Contact Us</Link> form on this Site or by calling 1-888-784-2670.
      </p>

      <h6>JOINING BOOK OF THE MONTH</h6>
      <p>
        To become a <em>Book of the Month</em> member, simply click any of the "join" buttons located throughout the Site. 
        You will be prompted to submit your name and email address, and then to select a membership plan and provide your 
        corresponding billing and shipping information. You may also be asked to answer a few questions about your reading 
        preferences.
      </p>

      <h6>HOW YOUR <em>BOOK OF THE MONTH</em> MEMBERSHIP WORKS</h6>
      <p>
        As a <em>Book of the Month</em> member, you will receive an email on the 1st of each month announcing our New Selections. 
        One of these New Selections will be pre-selected for you and placed in your "box." You will have until the end of the 
        6th day of the month to review the monthly selections and decide whether you want to keep the book that was pre-selected 
        for you, select a different book, add additional books to your box at the price indicated, or skip the month.  
        If you do not change your selection or skip the month, the book we selected for you will be shipped to you after the 
        7th day of the month along with any other books you have added to your box. If you join <em>Book of the Month</em> after 
        the 7th day of a month, your shipping date will be communicated to you as part of the enrollment process.
      </p>

      <h6>AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE</h6>
      <p>
        The membership plan you select will determine the length of your membership.  Unless you notify us before your current 
        membership period expires that you wish to change or cancel your membership plan by using the <Link className="link" to="/contact-us">Contact Us</Link> form on this 
        Site or by calling 1-888-784-2670, you understand that your membership will automatically renew on the last day of your 
        membership. As a member, you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to charge the then 
        applicable price of membership plus taxes, using the debit/credit card we have on file for you.  From time to time, we 
        may change the price associated with certain membership plans during the term of your membership; in such case, you will 
        be notified ahead of time and your membership will renew at the then-prevailing price.
        You must keep a valid credit/debit card on file in order to remain a <em>Book of the Month</em> Member. If you do not provide a 
        valid credit/debit card for two (2) or more consecutive months, we may cancel your membership.
      </p>

      <h6>SHIPPING</h6>
      <p>
        Shipping is free for all monthly box shipments; certain exclusions may apply from time to time. We will send you an 
        email notifying you when your box has shipped. You can find your order details and tracking information (when available) 
        on the order history page in the account section of the website. If shipment of your order is delayed, we will notify you 
        via email.
      </p>

      <h6>EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h6>
      <p>
        As part of your membership, we will send you emails advising you about club’s book selections, information about your 
        account, newsletters, special promotions and other updates to maximize your reading experience. You may opt-out of 
        promotional email by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of all promotional emails. We may share your 
        information with other clubs or websites operated by our parent or affiliated companies. From time to time, 
        <em>Book of the Month</em> may arrange for other companies to provide you with offers for products or services which may be of 
        interest to you.
      </p>

      <h6>GIFT MEMBERSHIPS</h6>
      <p>
        <em>Book of the Month</em> memberships are also available to purchase as a gift. To purchase a gift, click the “gift” buttons 
        found throughout the site, choose a delivery method (email or printable gift voucher), select a membership plan, and enter 
        the shipping and billing information required to complete the gift purchase. Gift memberships <u>do not</u> automatically renew 
        and will expire at the end of the membership term unless the gift recipient expressly chooses a renewal plan and enters 
        a valid credit card.  Gifts given to pre-existing members will be added to the end of that member’s current membership term. 
        All gift memberships must be activated by the recipient within 12 months of the date of purchase; however, the membership 
        term may extend beyond 12 months from the date of purchase.
      </p>

      <h6>REFER-A-FRIEND AND EARN BOOK CREDITS</h6>
      <p>
        When you invite friends to enroll in <em>Book of the Month</em>, you will receive 1 Free Book Credit for each friend who 
        enrolls in <em>Book of the Month</em> (this offer specifically excludes returning or existing members).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will only receive a Book Credit if your friend enrolls as a result of an invite from you via an authorized 
        referral method. If your friend does not click on the personal referral link in their invite email or other invite 
        mechanism, i.e., via a post on social media to accept your invitation, you will not receive a Book Credit.  
      </p>
      <p>
        You can track your Book Credits by visiting the Refer-A-Friend page in the Account section of the website. If two 
        people refer the same friend, the friend who sent the referral link that is used to create the new member's account 
        will be considered the referring friend, regardless of which referral link was sent to the new member first. There is a 
        limit of one Book Credit per new email address that is registered on <em>Book of the Month</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not use SPAM or send unsolicited emails to people you don't personally know to collect Book Credits and you 
        may not collect Book Credits by posting on message boards or other online venues in violation of such venues' terms of use.
        Book Credits can be applied toward the second or third books added to a monthly box, but cannot be applied toward the initial 
        monthly selection in a given month.  Book Credits may only be redeemed by current <em>Book of the Month</em> members and are valid for 12 
        months from issuance, unless the member’s account is terminated earlier in which case unredeemed Book Credits are forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Book Credits cannot be transferred between accounts or between users. Book Credits cannot be bartered, exchanged or sold.  
        Book Credits are a promotional offer and are not payment instruments, are issued without any exchange of money or value from you, 
        and you have no vested property right or interest in them. Book Credits have no cash value.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to limit or cancel your Book Credits in our sole discretion if we determine that you have violated these Terms, 
        including through fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by inviting fictitious people to join <em>Book of the Month</em>, 
          using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or 
          misleading information to us) or if we terminate your account for any reason. You may also be liable for civil and/or criminal 
        penalties under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right in our sole discretion at any time and without prior notice to you, to add to, remove or otherwise change the 
        terms applicable to the issuance and use of Book Credits. Such changes may include, without limitation, how you may earn and use Book 
        Credits, when Book Credits expire, minimum purchase amounts with which Book Credits may be used and the lifetime maximum amount of 
        Book Credits that you may earn.
      </p>

      <h6>CANCELLATION POLICY</h6>
      <p>
        If you are not completely satisfied with your membership, you may cancel it at any time by contacting Customer Service via the 
        <Link className="link" to="/contact-us">Contact Us</Link> form on this Site or by calling 1-888-784-2670. Your membership will continue until the expiration of the current 
        membership period and will not renew. We do not issue refunds for boxes that have already shipped or for partially completed 
        memberships.  We only issue refunds if you notify us that you wish to cancel prior to shipment of the first monthly box in your 
        current term of membership.
      </p>


      <h6>RETURNS</h6>
      <p>
        We only accept returns of damaged or defective books received within 30 days from the original date of shipment for replacement or 
        box selection credit; no refunds will be issued. If you return a damaged book, we will send you a replacement copy; or, if a 
        replacement copy is not available, one box selection credit will be applied to your <em>Book of the Month</em> membership account.

      <h6>PAYMENT OPTIONS</h6>
      <p>
        The credit/debit card you provide will be used for all future purchases and charges, including membership renewals. 
        You must keep a valid credit/debit card on file during the term of your membership and you must keep us up-to-date with accurate 
        member information, including your name, address, credit/debit card number and expiration date. You agree that we may update your 
        information with information your bank or credit card issuer may supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you become a member, if you wish to change your credit/debit card, just visit the Payment Info page in the account section of 
        our website. We will continue to apply your payments under this payment method unless you change your payment preference in the 
        account section of the website, or notify us through Member Services to change your billing preference. We accept payment by 
        credit/debit card (i.e., American Express, VISA, Discover and MasterCard).
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot process a charge to your card (for example, the card has expired or we cannot obtain authorization from your card issuer), 
        then for your convenience, we will attempt to charge any other credit/debit card that you have placed on file with us, in order to 
        prevent disruption of your membership. We are not responsible for any fees or charges that your bank, credit card/debit card issuer 
        may apply. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If your credit card issuer reverses a charge to your credit card, we may cancel your membership and suspend fulfillment of your 
        orders until payment is provided.  Alternatively, we may also seek payment by another method through a mailed statement. We may 
        report information about your account to credit bureaus.
