      <h6>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (public Law 105-304) Website Policy And Procedures For Compliance</h6>
      <p>
        In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
        this Site has adopted a policy toward copyright
        infringement on its book club website. In furtherance of this
        policy, this Site will block access to and/or remove any material
        that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has
        been illegally copied and submitted to our Site. This policy shall
        cover all aspects of the Site, including but not limited to author chats,
        images, graphics, book reviews, and all member-generated content posted
        on any portion of our Sites.
      </p>

      <h6>Procedure For Reporting Copyright Infringements</h6>
      <p>First, submit a formal Notice of Copyright Infringement containing the following information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The material being infringed or otherwise objectionable</li>
        <li>Where on the site the infringements are located</li>
        <li>The name of the person/entity complaining</li>
        <li>How this person/entity may be contacted</li>
        <li>A signed statement that the complainant has good faith belief that the material is infringing or unlawful and</li>
        <li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that content of the Notice is truthful and the complaint is expressly authorized by the copyright holder to submit the Notice.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Next, send the Notice of Copyright Infringement to this site’s Designated
        Copyright Infringement Agent: <em>Book of the Month</em>, 34 W 27th Street, 10th Floor, 
        New York, NY 10001 Attn: Legal Affairs Fax (516) 490-4021 or via email to:
        <a href="mailto:member.services@bookofthemonth.com">member.services@bookofthemonth.com</a>
      </p>

      <p>Within a reasonable time after this information is received, the following action will be taken:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The infringing material or Site will be blocked</li>
        <li>Reasonable efforts will be taken to promptly inform the infringing user of the situation</li>

        <li>To the extent possible, repeat offenders will be removed permanently from the system</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The infringing user may respond with a counter notice which may include a
        signed statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the user has a good
        faith belief that the removal or disablement was a result of a mistake or
        misidentification. A complete listing of the infringing user’s contact information
        and consent to jurisdiction in Federal Court in the infringing user’s district must
        also be included, along with a statement that the infringing user will accept service
        of process from the original complainant. If such counter notice is received by the
        site’s Designated Copyright Agent, a copy of the counter notice will be sent to the
        original complainant. The user’s material and access will be restored in 10 to 14
        days unless the Designated Copyright Agent is informed that a lawsuit has been filed
        over the infringing material.

      <h6 id="arbitration">Notice Of Arbitration Agreement</h6>
      <p>
        DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION<br/>
        You and Bookspan agree that any dispute between
        us (including disputes against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate,
        predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other) relating to:
        the Site; any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use
        of the Site; the purchase, order, installation, or use of Bookspan’s products
        or services; or communications between us; will be resolved exclusively and
        finally by binding arbitration and the arbitration decision may be enforced
        and judgment entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        You and Bookspan further agree that this arbitration agreement is made
        pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be
        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not by any state
        law concerning arbitration. You and Bookspan further agree that any
        determination regarding the applicability, enforceability, or validity of
        this arbitration agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by any court.
        BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
        In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel
        of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal,
        however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The
        arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
        and conducted under AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
        Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then
        in effect at the time of the dispute.
        ou may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879
        If you initiate arbitration, Bookspan will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA’s Procedures once you have notified Bookspan in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Bookspan is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Bookspan.  If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum.
        There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on
        a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim
        submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private
        attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative
        or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim
        submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
        claims against Bookspan and may not preside over any kind of representative or
        class proceeding against Bookspan. You acknowledge that this class action waiver
        is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties
        and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this
        class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’
        agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.
        
          YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER,
          YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST BOOKSPAN IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
          AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION
          OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION
          AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING, NOT USE
          THE SITE OR BOOKSPAN’S PRODUCTS, AND RETURN THE PRODUCT (UNOPENED AND UNUSED)
          FOR A REFUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH BOOKSPAN’S RETURN POLICY WITHIN 30 DAYS OF
          YOUR FIRST ORDER OF ANY OF BOOKSPAN’S PRODUCTS.
        
        Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if any provision of this Agreement
        is declared or found to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will
        be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or
        void and the remainder shall remain fully enforceable.
